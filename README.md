# Math for CS

## Introduction
Welcome to "Math for CS" â€“ an open-source mathematics textbook (note?) tailored for Computer Science students. This project serves as a comprehensive resource for those seeking to deepen their understanding of mathematical concepts crucial in the field of CS. It's also a personal journey, chronicling my learning path as I explore various topics in computer science mathematics.

## Project Status
This textbook (or probably note?) is a work in progress and will be updated irregularly. Expect new topics and interesting exercises to be added as my study journey progresses (I'm currently a Y1 student for CS).

## About the Book
"Math for CS" aims to cover a wide range of mathematic topics relevant to computer science, including but not limited to:
- Extention of high school and middle school Knowledge (done, but there may be revision in future)
- Discrete Math (To be finished by May)
- Continuous Math (complete Calculus) (To be finished by the end of the year)
- Probability, combinatorics, and statistics. (Working on the discrete part)
- Linear Algebra(with advanced contents)
- Information Theory(basics)
- Important Pure Math knowledge including abstract algebra, category theory and topology(scattered in important contents, no current plan to make it a independent chapter, but maybe I will write some independent oroject on them).
Each topic is accompanied by exercises and examples to reinforce learning and understanding.
All suggestions or corrections are welcome.
